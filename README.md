# Transformer-Encoders-For-Insider-Threats-Detection
Enhancing Insider Threat Detection Using User-Based Sequencing and Transformer Encoders

Insider threats pose a complex and challenging problem for organizations 
across government, public, and private sectors. The lack of sufficient
data has made detecting such threats extremely difficult. However, over the
last two decades, researchers have made significant progress in developing
Machine Learning (ML) solutions that can effectively detect, prevent, and
mitigate insider attacks. A 2023 report by the Ponemon Institute entitled
"The Cost of Insider Risk" found that 64% of organizations worldwide with
workforce ranging from 500 to over 75,000 employees consider ML to be
an essential tool in addressing insider incidents (Ponemon, 2023). This
highlights the industryâ€™s confidence in the power of Machine Learning to
tackle this pressing problem.
